== Frequently Asked Questions ==

**How do I add a blank or empty option**

If you want to add a blank or empty option half way through simply enter two commas in the options, for example:

`Option 1,,Option 2`

If you want the options of 'Option 1' and 'Option 2' but want the default option to be blank or empty you would enter:

`,Option 1,Option 2`
